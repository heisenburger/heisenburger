### Greetings, internet friend <3

I’m Serena. I care about creating well-crafted technology for a more kind and just world. I’ve been making and breaking the web since 1999, and have been plugged into the Matrix ever since.

While my formal training is in physics and mathematics, I love working in the intersections between fields. I’m interested in how the design of ecosystems affect the way we make and consume our technology.

For my day job I work as Staff Interaction Designer on Chrome, leading UX for [Chrome Security](https://chrome.security).
